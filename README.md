# Body mass index (BMI), is a measure of body fat based on height and weight that applies to adult men and women.
Body Mass Index is a simple calculation using a person’s height and weight. 
The formula is BMI = kg/m2 where kg is a person’s weight in kilograms and m2 is their height in metres squared.

# A BMI of 25.0 or more is overweight, while the healthy range is 18.5 to 24.9. BMI applies to most adults 18-65 years.
